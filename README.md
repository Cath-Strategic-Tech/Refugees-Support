# What is the Refugees Support app? 

The Refugees Support Application project develops and supports a CRM and program management solution for Canadian organizations sponsoring international refugees under the [Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program](https://www.rstp.ca/en/refugee-sponsorship/the-private-sponsorship-of-refugees-program/). The project's application is built on the Salesforce CRM platform and extends both Salesforce.org's Nonprofit Success Pack and Program Management Module.

# Use Case

## What is a SAH?
Canada's various refugee programs are covered by the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). One of the various programs overseen by the IRCC is a model of refugee sponsorship where a local entity (named a Sponsorship Agreement Holder, or SAH) can take responsibility for coordinating with other local groups and individuals to sponsor refugee families.  Becoming a SAH means the local entity has signed a sponsorship agreement with the Government of Canada to help support refugees from abroad when they resettle in Canada, and can work with others in the community (family members, interested parties) to do so. 

## Responsibilities of a Refugee Sponsorship Agreement Holder
[From the Refugee Sponsorship Training Program website](https://www.rstp.ca/en/refugee-sponsorship/sponsorship-agreement-holders/) 

- Providing adequate financial and settlement support and care to the sponsored refugees for the duration of the sponsorship period in accordance with the the relevant IRCC standards and policies.
- Pre-screening refugee sponsorship applications to ensure the refugees meet the eligibility and admissibility criteria of the PSR program.
- Screening its CGs and co-sponsors to ensure they have the capacity to fulfill their financial and settlement responsibilities and that they are not a danger to the personal safety of the refugees.
- Training, oversight and information sharing with their CGs and co-sponsors.
- Keeping records and documenting the financial and settlement support provided to the refugees sponsored under their agreement.
- Being prepared to provide financial and settlement support to the refugees sponsored under their agreement in the event that any CGs or co-sponsors they partnered with stop doing so.
- Not profiting financially from refugee sponsorship.
- Advising IRCC of any changes in the organization, such as the head of the organization, the main contacts or the signing authorities.
- Keeping track of their annual allocations, how many have been used and submitting applications to IRCC in a timely manner by the relevant deadlines.
- Preparing and submitting a report to IRCC at the end of each calendar year.
