# What is the Refugees Support app? 

The Refugees Support Application project develops and supports a CRM and program management solution for Canadian organizations sponsoring international refugees under the [Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program](https://www.rstp.ca/en/refugee-sponsorship/the-private-sponsorship-of-refugees-program/). The project's application is built on the Salesforce CRM platform and extends both Salesforce.org's Nonprofit Success Pack and Program Management Module.
